  P1AM-100 State change detection module (edge detection)

  This example shows how to detect when a P1AM input module
  changes from off to on and on to off.

  Often, you don't need to know the state of a digital input all the time, but
  you just need to know when the input changes from one state to another.
  For example, you want to know when a button goes from OFF to ON. This is called
  state change detection, or edge detection.
